It applies to current and former executive officers (\"Covered Officers\") and is designed to comply with the Compensation Recovery Rules under Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\\n\\n### Key Points:\\n\\n1. **Scope and Applicability**:\\n\\t- Applies to incentive compensation received by Covered Officers after the policy\\'s effective date (October 2, 2023).\\n\\t- Covers compensation tied to financial reporting measures, such as stock price, total shareholder return (TSR), or other metrics derived from the company\\'s financial statements.\\n2. **Recovery of Incentive Compensation**:\\n\\t- In the event of an accounting restatement, NVIDIA must recover any excess incentive compensation received by Covered Officers during the three fiscal years preceding the restatement.\\n\\t- Recovery is required regardless of whether the Covered Officer engaged in misconduct or was at fault.\\n\\t- The company may use various methods to recover compensation, including direct repayment, forfeiture of deferred compensation, or cancellation of future awards.\\n3. **Exceptions**:\\n\\t- Recovery is not required if the cost of enforcement exceeds the amount to be recovered or if recovery would jeopardize the tax-qualified status of a retirement plan.\\n\\t- The Committee may determine recovery is impracticable in certain circumstances.\\n4. **Administration and Compliance**:\\n\\t- The Compensation Committee (or a majority of independent board members) administers the policy.\\n\\t- NVIDIA must disclose and file reports related to the policy as required by law.\\n\\t- The policy does not limit the company\\'s other legal remedies against Covered Officers.\\n5. **Employee Responsibilities**:\\n\\t- Employees are required to report violations of the policy and cooperate with investigations.\\n\\t- Reports can be made anonymously through NVIDIA\\'s Speak Up system.\\n6. **Amendments and Termination**:\\n\\t- The policy may be amended or terminated by the Committee to ensure compliance with applicable laws or listing standards.\\n\\nThis policy ensures accountability and aligns with regulatory requirements for executive compensation recovery.'"
